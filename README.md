# Advanced-Name-Screening-and-Entity-Linking-with-Existing-NLP-Models


In collaboration with Solytics Partners, we contributed to a machine learning system for **assessing credit risk in banking**. The system identifies high-risk individuals by extracting names from negative news reports and matching them against a database. Our research included evaluating various NLP models and name matching techniques such as BERT, RoBERTa, XLNet, TF-IDF Similarity, and Fuzzy Name Matching. The best results were achieved with BERT-CRF and XLM-RoBERTa models for NER and the Naive TF-IDF method for Name Matching. The project successfully applied AI in risk assessment despite challenges like data scarcity, indicating the potential for large language models in future improvements.

Due to confidentiality, only part of the codes are added to this repository for reference.
